# Asynchronous Programming in C#

## Overview
This solution contains 12 projects demonstrating various aspects of asynchronous programming in C#, including tasks, async/await patterns, concurrency, and parallelism concepts.

## Attribution
This project is based on the original work by [Metigator](https://github.com/metigator):

### Modifications
This repository contains my personal modifications and enhancements to the original codebase for learning and experimentation purposes.

## Projects Included

1. **CA01ThreadVsTasks** - Comparison between threads and tasks
2. **CA02TaskReturnsValue** - Working with tasks that return values
3. **CA03LongRunningTask** - Handling long-running operations
4. **CA04ExceptionPropagation** - Exception handling in async code
5. **CA05TaskContinuation** - Task continuation patterns
6. **CA06TaskDelay** - Using Task.Delay effectively
7. **CA07SyncVsAsync** - Synchronous vs Asynchronous patterns
8. **CA08AsyncFunctions** - Async function implementation
9. **CA09CancellationToken** - Cancellation token usage
10. **CA10ReportProgress** - Progress reporting in async operations
11. **CA11TaskCombinators** - Combining multiple tasks
12. **CA12ConcurrencyAndParallelism** - Concurrency and parallelism concepts

## Learning Resources
For a comprehensive understanding of these concepts, I recommend watching the original tutorial video linked above.
